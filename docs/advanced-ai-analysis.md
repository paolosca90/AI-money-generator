## 🔄 Integration Architecture

### Signal Aggregation Method
The enhanced system uses a weighted ensemble approach:

| Component | Weight | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Price Action | 20% | Trend and structure analysis |
| Smart Money | 20% | Institutional flow detection |
| VWAP Signals | 15% | Volume-weighted positioning |
| Machine Learning | 15% | Pattern recognition and prediction |
| Orderbook | 10% | Market microstructure |
| Options | 10% | Gamma/delta positioning |
| Gemini AI | 10% | Contextual analysis |

### Confidence Calculation
Enhanced confidence scoring incorporates:
- Signal alignment across components (max +8 points)
- Individual component confidence levels
- Consensus strength measurement
- Historical accuracy adjustments
- Breakout probability factors

Base confidence: 60% (reduced due to complexity)
Maximum confidence: 95% (with strong consensus)

### Error Handling & Fallbacks
