## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### 1. Configure Your Bot Token

Your bot token is already configured in the code:
```
7774671041:AAEUT6ih4lM1qWGvmsLQudHy58eWK8Kv7CY
```

### 2. Deploy to Encore Cloud

```bash
# From the repository root
cd backend
encore run  # Test locally first
encore deploy  # Deploy to production
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

In your Encore Cloud dashboard, configure these secrets:

```bash
# Required
TelegramBotToken=7774671041:AAEUT6ih4lM1qWGvmsLQudHy58eWK8Kv7CY

# Optional (for enhanced features)
GeminiApiKey=your_gemini_api_key
NewsApiKey=your_news_api_key  
AlphaVantageApiKey=your_alpha_vantage_key
AdminUserId=your_telegram_user_id
DefaultVPSPassword=secure_default_password
```

### 4. Set Up Webhook

After deployment, set your webhook URL:

```bash
# Use your deployed URL
node bot-setup.js webhook https://your-app.encore.run/telegram/webhook
```

### 5. Test Your Bot

```bash
# Test the bot token
node bot-setup.js test

# Check webhook status  
node bot-setup.js info
```

---

## 👥 Client Setup Process

### For Each New Client:

#### 1. Create Client Subscription
```bash
# Use the API to create a subscription
curl -X POST https://your-app.encore.run/telegram/client/subscribe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": 123456789,
    "subscriptionType": "premium",
    "features": ["advanced_signals", "vps_management", "mt5_integration", "analytics", "risk_management", "priority_support", "backtesting"],
    "durationDays": 30
  }'
```

#### 2. Client Uses the Bot
1. Client starts conversation with @Hedgingrevolution_bot
2. Client uses `/subscription` to check their plan
3. Client uses `/vps_setup` to configure their VPS and MT5
4. Client starts getting signals with `/predict BTCUSD`

---

## 🛡️ Security & Configuration

### Database Security
- All passwords are encrypted in the database
- VPS credentials are stored securely
- Client data is isolated by user ID

### API Security
- Webhook validates Telegram signatures
- All API endpoints include error handling
- User access is controlled by subscription features

### VPS Security
- SSH connections use encrypted credentials
- Installation scripts are validated
- MT5 connections use secure protocols

---

## 💰 Monetization Setup

### Payment Integration (Recommended)

Add a payment processor like Stripe:

```typescript
// Add to client-manager.ts
export const processPayment = api<PaymentRequest, PaymentResponse>(
  { method: "POST", path: "/client/payment" },
  async (req) => {
    // Integrate with Stripe/PayPal
    // Update client subscription on successful payment
  }
);
```

### Manual Client Management

For now, manually create subscriptions via the API or database:

```sql
-- Basic Plan Example
INSERT INTO client_configurations (
  user_id, subscription_type, features, expiry_date,
  max_vps_configurations, max_mt5_accounts, is_active
) VALUES (
  123456789, 'basic', 
  '["basic_signals", "vps_management", "mt5_integration", "analytics"]',
  NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days', 1, 1, true
);
```
